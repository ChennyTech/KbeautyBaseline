> **Abstract:** *A good image-to-image translation model should learn a mapping between different visual domains while satisfying the following properties: 1) diversity of generated images and 2) scalability over multiple domains. Existing methods address either of the issues, having limited diversity or multiple models for all domains. We propose StarGAN v2, a single framework that tackles both and shows significantly improved results over the baselines. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and a new animal faces dataset (AFHQ) validate our superiority in terms of visual quality, diversity, and scalability. To better assess image-to-image translation models, we release AFHQ, high-quality animal faces with large inter- and intra-domain variations. The code, pre-trained models, and dataset are available at clovaai/stargan-v2.*

## TensorFlow implementation
The TensorFlow implementation of StarGAN v2 by our team member junho can be found at [clovaai/stargan-v2-tensorflow](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2-tensorflow).

## Software installation
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2.git
cd stargan-v2/
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n stargan-v2 python=3.6.7
conda activate stargan-v2
conda install -y pytorch=1.4.0 torchvision=0.5.0 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
conda install x264=='1!152.20180717' ffmpeg=4.0.2 -c conda-forge
pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30 ffmpeg-python==0.2.0 scikit-image==0.16.2
pip install pillow==7.0.0 scipy==1.2.1 tqdm==4.43.0 munch==2.5.0
```

## Datasets and pre-trained networks
We provide a script to download datasets used in StarGAN v2 and the corresponding pre-trained networks. The datasets and network checkpoints will be downloaded and stored in the `data` and `expr/checkpoints` directories, respectively.

<b>CelebA-HQ.</b> To download the [CelebA-HQ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4qLcYyJmiz0TXY1NG02bzZVRGs) dataset and the pre-trained network, run the following commands:
```bash
bash download.sh celeba-hq-dataset
bash download.sh pretrained-network-celeba-hq
bash download.sh wing
```

<b>AFHQ.</b> To download the [AFHQ](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2/blob/master/README.md#animal-faces-hq-dataset-afhq) dataset and the pre-trained network, run the following commands:
```bash
bash download.sh afhq-dataset
bash download.sh pretrained-network-afhq
```


## Generating interpolation videos
After downloading the pre-trained networks, you can synthesize output images reflecting diverse styles (e.g., hairstyle) of reference images. The following commands will save generated images and interpolation videos to the `expr/results` directory. 


<b>CelebA-HQ.</b> To generate images and interpolation videos, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py --mode sample --num_domains 2 --resume_iter 100000 --w_hpf 1 \
               --checkpoint_dir expr/checkpoints/celeba_hq \
               --result_dir expr/results/celeba_hq \
               --src_dir assets/representative/celeba_hq/src \
               --ref_dir assets/representative/celeba_hq/ref
```

## Evaluation metrics
To evaluate StarGAN v2 using [Fr&eacute;chet Inception Distance (FID)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) and [Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924), run the following commands:


```bash
# celeba-hq
python main.py --mode eval --num_domains 2 --w_hpf 1 \
               --resume_iter 100000 \
               --train_img_dir data/celeba_hq/train \
               --val_img_dir data/celeba_hq/val \
               --checkpoint_dir expr/checkpoints/celeba_hq \
               --eval_dir expr/eval/celeba_hq



## Training networks
To train StarGAN v2 from scratch, run the following commands. Generated images and network checkpoints will be stored in the `expr/samples` and `expr/checkpoints` directories, respectively. Training takes about three days on a single Tesla V100 GPU. Please see [here](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2/blob/master/main.py#L86-L179) for training arguments and a description of them. 

```bash
# celeba-hq
python main.py --mode train --num_domains 2 --w_hpf 1 \
               --lambda_reg 1 --lambda_sty 1 --lambda_ds 1 --lambda_cyc 1 \
               --train_img_dir data/celeba_hq/train \
               --val_img_dir data/celeba_hq/val
```

```bash
bash download.sh afhq-dataset
```
